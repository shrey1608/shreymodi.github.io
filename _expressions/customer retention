title: "Customer Retention and ROI Optimization System for E-commerce Promotions"
excerpt: "Merchants often gain many new customers through promotions, but a significant portion of these customers are only interested in one-time deals. The impact of promotions on long-term sales may be limited. This project aims to design a system that maximizes return on investment (ROI), reduces promotional costs, and identifies one-time buyers. The system analyzes a dataset containing information on promotional shopping events from an e-commerce platform."
