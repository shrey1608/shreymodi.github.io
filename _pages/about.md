Hi! I am Shrey Modi a passionate researcher and developer pursuing his masters from California State University Long beach. I am currently advised by [Dr Amin Rezaei](http://aminrezaei.com/en/) under [Computer Architecture, Reliability, and Security Laboratory (CARS-Lab)](http://aminrezaei.com/en/cars-lab) on solving the problems of [Common Weakness Enumeration(CWE)](https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html) using machine learning and deep learning. I am interested in image processing, machine learning, deep learnig, data analysis, software development and algorithms.

## My work and research
I employ a comprehensive approach to my research, employing a combination of qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to thoroughly examine and understand complex systems in the realms of technology and knowledge production.  I aim to unlock new possibilities and empower AI systems to make informed decisions under uncertain conditions. Furthermore, I am enthusiastic about integrating formal methods into the realm of machine learning and deep learning, with the ultimate goal of advancing the reliability, safety, and robustness of AI systems in real-world scenarios with a focus on software developement and making advancements in MLOps. I also review research papers in artificial intelligence domain at various conferences and journals.

## My background and history
I am undergoing my MS in Computer Science from [California State University Long Beach](https://www.csulb.edu/), I completed my Bachelors in technology in Information Technology from [Charusat University](https://www.charusat.ac.in/).I gained valuable experience through internships at prestigious institutions such as [Indian Space Research Organisation(ISRO)](https://www.isro.gov.in/) and [Physical Research Laboratory(PRL)](https://www.prl.res.in/prl-eng/) where I worked as a research intern.

## My intellectual communities
Iâ€™m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like computer science and Artificial Intelligence.I am a dedicated, enthusiastic,versatile developer and researcher  with a passion for creating innovative solutions.Beyond technical skills, I am a collaborative team player with excellent interpersonal skills. I thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment, leveraging my communication and adaptability to foster strong working relationships. With a keen eye for detail and a commitment to delivering high-quality work, I consistently strive for excellence in every project I undertake. I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and new media / internet studies.
