### [Facial Emotion Recognition using Convolution Neural Network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9432156)
* **Authors:** Shrey Modi; Mohammed Husain Bohara
* **Published Date:** 05/2023
* **Journal/Conference:** 2021 5th International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems (ICICCS)
* **Abstract:** With the transition from laboratory-controlled to daunting in-the-wild conditions of facial Emotion recognition (FER) and the recent popularity of deep learning strategies in various fields, deep neural networks[1], [2] have rapidly been leveraged to train discriminatory representations for automated FER. The FER will allow us to recognize the Emotion of the human face that is a major blow to recent technological development. Recent FER programmers are typically concentrating on two critical issues: overfitting due to lack of appropriate training evidence and emotion-related differences such as lighting, head posture and identification bias. It encourages to improve the other innovations, such as incorporating FER into the robotic device in order to provide the robot feelings. A systematic survey of deep FER including datasets and algorithms that offer insight into these inherent issues. First, the FER scheme with the relevant context information and recommendations for the implementations to be applied at each level. Introducing the relevant datasets that are commonly used in the literature and including agreed data collection and assessment criteria for these data sets. Competitive results on commonly used metrics that can be used to develop the project to the maximum degree that, in essence, helps more developments and the environment. The main motivation to work is to improve the accuracy for the following model statement which could make an impact on the future work. Along with that a comparative analysis between the used model and transfer learning model will provide a proper novelty for the research work.

### [ Comparative Analysis of Psychometric Prediction System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9588950)
* **Authors:** Shrey Modi, Virti Shah
* **Published Date:** 10/2021
* **Journal/Conference:** 2021 Smart Technologies, Communication and Robotics (STCR)
* **Abstract:** The quest to know more regarding the inner workings of the human brain and how that affects the course of actions we take has been unabated by recent technological developments in the integrated fields of psychology and computation. The eclectic collection of people participating actively on social media has led data scientists and machine learning engineers to analyse and infer from the gratuitous data available in profound quantities. There have been multiple approaches germane to the subject in hand using deep learning. The most prevalent one is the Big Five or OCEAN model which scrutinizes the dispositions or the acquired traits and then divides them into 5 broad colloquial categories namely: “Open to Experience”, “conscientiousness”, “extraversion”, “agreeableness” and “neuroticism”. Furthermore, Convolutional neural networking architecture has been used to hypothesize personality prediction in numerous ways, including handwriting analysis and hate-speech analysis. The motivation of the paper was to not use the convolutional neural network and try the other learning models which can give a good output and do a comparison which would indeed help to differentiate while choosing the algorithm for the other users, so we have compared two.

### [Employee Attrition System Using Tree Based Ensemble Method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9689398)
* **Authors:** Shrey Modi,Vimoli Mehta
* **Published Date:** 01/2022
* **Journal/Conference:** 2021 2nd International Conference on Communication, Computing and Industry 4.0 (C2I4)
* **Abstract:** Employee attrition has become a vital problem across the world. It is one of the crucial issues faced by business leaders within companies where they lose the most talented employees. A good employee is always an asset to the organization and their resignation can lead to various problems like financial losses, overall performance, and loss of acquired knowledge. Furthermore, hiring new employees is far exorbitant, taxing, and time-consuming in comparison to recruiting the existing one. It is very time-consuming to recruit a new employee as it takes him months for training, adjusting to the culture, rules, and environment. Therefore, upcoming trends and technology using Machine Learning Algorithms must be exploited for the benefit of business organizations. Knowing the reason beforehand for the employee attrition, companies can mitigate this loss. This paper provides a conclusive review of employee attrition using the tree-based Ensemble Machine Learning Model from the dataset ‘IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Performance’.A collection of statistically significant factors which connect to an employee's decision to leave are identified. The paper evaluates the tree-based ensemble to get the best results from the existing tree methods.
