## Projects

### Customer Retention and ROI Optimization System - 2023
- Conducted in-depth analysis, visualization, and feature engineering of a large-scale e-commerce dataset to identify trends in
customer behavior and assess the impact of promotions on sales. Implemented dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA
and t-SNE for improved modeling and prediction capabilities.
- Developed and evaluated prediction models, including Bayes Classifier, nearest neighbors, and neural networks, to identify repeat
buyers and design a recommendation system. Utilized evaluation metrics to assess model performance and provided
comprehensive recommendations for addressing the challenge of one-time buyers.


### Artsy Store (E-Commerce Website) - 2022

- Developed a fully functional e-commerce website for my captured photographs using the Django framework, showcasing my photography portfolio and enabling customers to purchase prints.
- Designed and implemented a responsive frontend using Bootstrap, ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for customers.
- Utilized Django's ORM to interact with the database, ensuring efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
- Integrated the Stripe payment method to facilitate secure and seamless online transactions.

### ResRank (A Resume Ranker) - 2022

- Developed a resume ranker application using Flask, integrating it with ML algorithms for efficient resume evaluation and ranking.
- Integrated an Aptitude Test mode and an Interview Practice mode, offering candidates a comprehensive platform.
- Utilized machine learning algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosting, including natural language processing (NLP) techniques, to analyze resumes and extract relevant information.
- Applied techniques such as named entity recognition (NER), text classification, and information extraction to automate the process of resume evaluation and candidate screening.
