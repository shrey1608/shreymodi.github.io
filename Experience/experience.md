### California State University Long Beach
**Graduate Research Assistant**  
*Long Beach, USA*  
*07/2023 – present*
- Designed and Implemented a unique GNN-Transformer model to enhance vulnerability detection and prioritization, resulting in a 20% reduction in false positives compared to previous state of the art techniques.
- Designing data-centric strategies to strengthen hardware and software frameworks preemptively countering potential threats and increasing accuracy from 78 % to 90 % which makes it an innovative solution to 100+ problems.

### Physical Research Laboratory(PRL)
**Research Intern**  
*Ahmedabad, India*  
*05/2022 – 11/2022*
- Indian Lunar Mission: Leveraged advanced data mining techniques to preprocess and analyze a large-scale lunar dataset exceeding 500GB in size, achieving a 25% reduction in data preprocessing time through optimization.
- Designed and implemented a custom image processing pipeline resulting in a 15% increase in image quality and a 10% reduction in noise. Validated algorithm and improved the accuracy from 76% to 84% along with performance testing.

### Indian Space Research Organisation(ISRO)
**Research Intern**  
*Ahmedabad, India*  
*04/2021 – 09/2021*
- Visual Positioning System: Orchestrated VPS application employing Image Processing and machine learning (ML) resulting in a 37% reduction in processing time compared to the previous system. Conducted comprehensive functionality tests that led to a remarkable 40% increase in product scalability after algorithm integration to the system.
- Developed efficient algorithm using brute force matching reducing query time to 0.3s from 1.7s using nonlinear optimization.

### Firecamp.io
**Software Developer Intern**  
*Surat, India*  
*04/2020 - 09/2020*
- Utilized backend aid for REST API and web socket package. Implemented predefined GraphQL queries for dataset generation improving the data quality by 30% while also optimizing the workflow through a CI/CD pipeline and containerization with Kubernetes to enhance scalability and deployment efficiency by 28%.
- Conducted Automated API and JSON payload tests for HTTP web socket and Socket.IO requests. Created auto JSON schemas to ensure a consistent format executed rigorous unit testing achieving a 98% test pass rate.
